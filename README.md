This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can view the Home Page on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) using your browser.

The Api's are available on [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api) using your browser.

You can also Test an API using [http://localhost:3000/api/test](http://localhost:3000/api/test) using your browser.
It'll respond to you as `{ message: "Server is Running" }`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
